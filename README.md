### Overview
This is the CO-project developed by Somay Jalan (2022505), Swarnima Prasad (2022525), Tanishk Singh (2022612), and Sidhartha Garg (2022499). It includes an assembler and simulator with specific features.

### Folder Structure
- `/CO_A_P1/Simple_Assembler`: Contains `assembler_final.py` with `stdin` and `stdout` functionality for the assembler.
- `/CO_A_P1/final_assembler`: Contains `assembler_final.py` with input from `input.txt` and output to `output.txt`.
- `/final_simulator`: Contains the simulator which takes binary input (`stdin`) and outputs the trace (`stdout`).
- `/Q3`: Includes folders with assembler and simulator code for a specific assignment.

### Usage
- Assembler: Run `assembler_final.py` with appropriate input/output configurations.
- Simulator: Utilize `final_simulator` to process binary input and produce trace output.
- Automated Testing: Supported for both simulator and assembler functionalities.

### Features
- **Assembler**: Converts assembly code into machine code for the specified ISA, handling instructions, labels, and variables.
- **Simulator**: Executes machine code, handling operations, computations, and memory dumps.
- **Automated Testing**: Includes a suite of tests for correctness and reliability.
- **Floating Point Computation**: Supports floating-point operations.
- **Error Handling & Flag Register**: Generates errors for invalid instructions and sets flags for overflows.
